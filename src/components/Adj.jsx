        <p>Filters offers traditional image adjustments like brightness, contrast, exposure,
          saturation, color temperature and more, but also introduces five brand new adjustments:
          <strong> Shine</strong>, <strong> Luna</strong>, <strong> Intimidate</strong>,
          <strong> Color Boost</strong> and <strong> Smart Fade</strong>. These custom multi-effects intelligently
          assess image color data and let you add drama, vibrancy or the perfect retro look to your photograph.
